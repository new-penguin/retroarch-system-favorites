# Retroarch System Favorites

This script will copy your Retroarch favorites to the relevant system playlist, append a * so they're first to show, and remove the old playlist game entry in both favorites and the system playlist to reduce redundancy. Retroarch doesn't support special characters like ‚≠ê so we'll have to make due with appending an asterisk for now.  You can set this to run upon OS boot or run just before Retroarch executes like such...

```./retroarch-system-favorites.bin & retroarch```
